In r8 Omar has added LUFA USB library (http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php) to the SCD project. There is now a Virtual Serial Port application. 

Connect the SCD to a PC/Host via usb, select the Virtual Serial application from the menu and then communicate from the PC/host to the SCD using a terminal (tty, serial emulator). On the host side I can warmly recommend 
gtkterm which can be used for example in Ubuntu as follows:
`gtkterm -p /dev/ttyACM0`
(if ttyACM0 is the virtual serial port in your system). For more information please refer to this link:
