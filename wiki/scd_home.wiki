Welcome to the Smart Card Detective (SCD) open source project on Google Code.

= Introduction =

The SCD is a general framework for research on smartcards. It allows you to monitor any smartcard application (including Chip and PIN / EMV transactions) as well as create your custom applications.

The software is completely open source (GPL license) and the hardware can be bought from [http://www.smartarchitects.co.uk/opencart/ Smart Architects].


= Details =

The SCD has started as the MPhil thesis of Omar Choudary at University of Cambridge. In its first versions it has been used for several experiments on Chip and PIN. The current hardware/software is a revised version including USB communication (based on [www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA]), python command line interface and new functionality.

The device has a smartcard interface as well as a terminal/reader interface, allowing the SCD to act as a passive/active monitor between a card and a reader or emulate a card or a terminal.

Using the python command line interface you can interact with the SCD using a PC. This allows a more flexible operation, although the SCD also features many stand-alone applications and a battery so you can also use it without a PC.
